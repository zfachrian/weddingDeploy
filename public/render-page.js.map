I definitely know nothing about marriage but people says its the bittersweet of life. But I know one thing you guys can be each other the best of friends, parents, leader, guidance, partner not in crime but in the good thing I know ( crime only can be done by Dinda while in university ) ehehhehehe. Hope you guys prosper and also can be the source to share good value not only for your family but also for the lots and lots of people. May God Bless You both and your \"soon to be\" family.
